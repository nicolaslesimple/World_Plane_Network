# World_Plane_Network
This repository is composed of two projects about the Airplanes World Network. 

The first one, called 'Midterm' is using classic analytics tools of network analysis to well understand the global dataset.

The second one, called 'Final_Project' tries to make an anlysis on the spreading of an infection in this network and study the different methods of quarantine that can be used to stop the spreading.
